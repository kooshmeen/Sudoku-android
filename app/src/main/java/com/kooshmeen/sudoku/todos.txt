TODO for adding multiplayer/other functionalities which include a server:
add groups functionality - create groups--, join groups--, view group leaderboards
add medals for top of group every week, month, day etc
add way to challenge friends (same puzzle, best time wins, maybe mistake count etc)

NAT punch through

-When a leader leaves a group, another member at random is promoted to leader. If no other member exists, the group is deleted (if private).
-When a user is logged in but their token is expired, they are automatically logged out
